# actor-awards

## Overview
This project is a C++ application designed to efficiently manage and process actor-related data. It awards points to actors of your choosing and keeps a ranked list of these actors based on points acquired. It showcases the use of custom data structures, a robust parsing system, and a complex model for managing actor entities, demonstrating advanced skills in object-oriented programming, data management, and algorithmic efficiency.

## Features
Dynamic Data Structures: Implementation of custom dynamic arrays, binary search trees (BST), and heaps for optimized data storage and retrieval.
Actor and ActorDB Classes: Detailed modeling of actor entities and a comprehensive database-like structure (ActorDB) for efficient management of these objects.
Efficient Data Parsing: A robust parser component capable of handling and transforming various forms of data inputs.
Advanced Data Management: Functionalities include adding, removing, searching, and sorting actors, with BST and heap algorithms for effective data organization.
Automated Compilation: Includes a Makefile for streamlined compilation and build processes in Unix/Linux environments.
